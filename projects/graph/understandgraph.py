#HOW TO SOLVE ANY GRAPH PROBLEM:

#Translate the problem into graph terminology
    #What are the vertices, edges, weights (if needed)?

#Build your graph
    #Do you even need to build a graph? Should you use an adjacency matrix/list?

#Traverse your graph
    #Should you use BFS/DFS? Do you need an auxiliary data structure? (list containing path?)
